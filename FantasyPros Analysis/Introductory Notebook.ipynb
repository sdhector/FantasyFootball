    "This notebook is an End to End project where I Extract the data, tidy and transform it to a tabular format, create a database and load the data into tables, then I read from it using SQL to do some Exploratory Data Analysis and publish that to Github as a Notebook. Then, I create a Dashboard that allows one to view the available data. Next, I develop a Lifetime Value model and load the predictions into the database and publish the notebook. I also create a Best Comparable Model and publish the notebook. Finally put it all together in an interactive application which allows the user to select the player and get a profile, the predictions of the Lifetime Value model, and the Best Comparable tool. "
