# FantasyFootball
A Fantasy Football End-to-End Data Science Project

The goal of this project is to reproduce a complete Data Science workflow from the extraction of the data using NflscrapR play by play data, loading them into a PostgreSQL database in tabular format, reading it into multiple Jupyter Notebooks to describe and create a series of analyses (EDA, Best Comparable, Lifetime Value), as well as creating a Dashboard and an Interactive Application.
